# =============================================================================
#  sidecar.jl — the long-lived Julia companion of MFH Studio.
#
#  Loading MeanFieldHom costs ~10 s, so it is paid once and the process then
#  answers requests on stdin. The protocol is JSON lines: one request object
#  per line in, one response object per line out. Everything the interface
#  needs from Julia goes through here -- the feature catalog, 3-D traces,
#  reading an existing script, and running one.
#
#  Anything printed by user code would corrupt the protocol, so stdout is
#  redirected for the duration of every request and the captured text is
#  returned as data instead.

#
#  Maintenance script, run **by hand**, never at test or documentation time: the
#  tests and script 84 load the committed JSON, which is what keeps the suite
#  deterministic and the doc build free of Lux.

#      julia scripts/nn/train_models.jl                # all three
#      julia scripts/nn/train_models.jl conduction     # one model only
#
#  Model names: elastic, conduction, triaxial, affine.
#
#  Teachers are the *analytic* Hill tensors, so the labels are exact and the
#  only error in the pipeline is the fit itself.  That is the whole point of the
#  ellipsoid pilot: it is the one morphology where a surrogate can be held to a
#  closed form.

#  test_H_oracle.jl
#
#  Independent oracle for the crack compliance contribution tensor ℍ.
#
#  The other crack tests compare ℍ against the closed form of the COD tensor
#  𝐁 — which is precisely what `src/Cracks/cod_analytical.jl` implements, so
#  they cannot detect an error in that closed form itself.  This file closes
#  the loop by evaluating the *definition* instead
#  (see the `cod_tensor` docstring in `src/Cracks/api.jl`):
#
#      ℍ = lim_{c/b→0} (c/b) ℚ⁻¹ ,      ℚ = ℂ − ℂ:ℙ:ℂ
#
#  starting from `hill_tensor` on a flattened `Ellipsoid(a, b, ω·b)`.  The
#  path ℙ → ℚ → ℚ⁻¹ → limit never touches the COD closed form, so agreement
#  is genuine evidence and not a tautology.  This is the exercise of the
#  Echoes manual appendix (`crack_compliance.qmd`, figure `fig-errorH`).
#
#  What is actually asserted:  a single ω would not distinguish a true limit
#  from a coincidence, so the test checks that the error *decreases at the
#  expected order*.  Convergence is O(ω) (first-order Taylor term of the Hill
#  tensor, Barthélémy 2009), hence a factor ≈ 10 between ω = 1e-2 and
#  ω = 1e-3; the threshold is set at 5 to leave room for the quadrature.
#
#  Backend note: `method = :residues` is NOT usable here — it returns NaN on
#  ellipsoids flatter than about c ≈ 1e-3 (independently of `reltol`), which
#  is exactly the regime this oracle lives in.  The nested-QuadGK backend is
#  validated down to ω = 1e-3 in `test/Elasticity/test_hill_nestedquadgk_oblate.jl`,
#  which is why the sweep stops there.

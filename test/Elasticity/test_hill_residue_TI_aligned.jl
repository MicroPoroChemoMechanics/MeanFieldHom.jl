# PR-2 validation: residue algorithm robustness for TI / ORTHO matrices
# aligned with the ellipsoid principal axes (mirror of the C++ test
# tests/python/echoes_tests/hill_residues_TI_aligned.py).
#
# Before this PR the residue path silently dropped the contribution of
# multiple roots (PolynomialRoots Newton polish skipped them), producing
# wrong Hill tensor values. The new path (a) detects multiplicities via the
# scale-relative polynomial-derivative criterion in
# `_gather_almost_multiple_roots`, (b) uses the multiplicity-2 / -3 residue
# formulas ported from polynoms.h, and (c) when multiplicity exceeds the
# implemented formulas (or PolynomialRoots fails to converge), silently
# falls back to the DECUHR backend.
